# wikipathways-map

This repository contains several python scripts to build
a network of relations between WikiPathways pathways and
external vocabularies.

## Data

- Pathway-disease relationships extracted from WikiPathways
- Pathway-PW relationships extracted from WikiPathways
- Orthologous pathways inside WikiPathways generated by lexical matching with [Gilda](https://github.com/indralab/gilda)
- ComPath relationships
- Biomappings relationships

## Visualization

The network can be viewed on [NDEx](https://public.ndexbio.org/viewer/networks/2b3ed6af-5031-11eb-9e72-0ac135e8bacf)

## Sources

- WikiPathways
